## OUR USER STORY

##

## MVP

**This application is essentially a data filter that uses API's to sort information into the appopriate category**

We have 4 todo's that are categorized as one of the following:

1. Film / Series
2. Restaurants, cafes, etc. (To eat)
3. Books (To read)
4. Products (To buy)

**What they should be able to do**

- "As a user, I want to be able to input something and have it stored in the appropriate list, because it saves me time and helps me stay more organized.

- I can edit the todo list, deleting reminders.

**What they should NOT be able to do**

- "????"

## USER SCENARIOS

- Wife calls husband, asks him to pick up celery on the way home.. Husband opens "SMART-TODO"
  and types in "Don't forget to pick up the celery". SMART-TODO takes this data and sorts it into the appopriate list, in this case, Products(To buy).
